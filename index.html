    <p>Subway Surfers[a] is a 2012 endless runner mobile game which is co-developed by Kiloo and SYBO Games, private companies based in Denmark. It is available on iOS, Android, HarmonyOS, Amazon Fire Tablet, and Windows Phone platforms and uses the Unity game engine.[2] In the game, players take the role of young graffiti artists, led by Jake who, upon being caught in the act of tagging a metro railway site, run through the railroad tracks to escape from the inspector and his dog. As they run, they grab gold coins, power-ups, and many other items while simultaneously dodging collisions with trains and other objects. They can also jump on top of the trains and surf with hoverboards to evade capture until the character crashes into an obstacle, gets caught by the inspector, or gets hit by a train, at which point the game ends. Special events, such as the Season Hunt and others, including the game's birthday events, the Super Runners Challenge and Rivals Challenge, can result in in-game rewards and characters. Also with points and keys they can buy different outfits and characters.
    Subway Surfers is an endless runner video game. The game starts by tapping the screen, while Jake (the game's main character) or any other character sprays graffiti on a subway, and gets caught in the act by the inspector and his dog, who starts chasing the character. While running, the player can swipe up, down, left, or right to avoid crashing into oncoming obstacles especially moving trains, poles, tunnel walls, and barriers. By swiping rapidly as speed increases, more points can be acquired. A crash results in a game over, but the player can revive and continue by using keys or watching an ad. The player can collect various items such as coins, keys, x2 multipliers, super sneakers, jetpacks, magnets, mystery boxes, and pogo sticks. A pogo stick provides combustion by launching up the character, a jetpack gives the ability to fly, a coin magnet attracts coins on the track, super sneakers give the ability to jump higher, and a x2 multiplier multiplies the rate at which the score counts. Items, such as a hoverboard (which could be used by double-tapping on the screen), allow the character to avoid collisions and last about 30 seconds.

        Daily Challenges and Season Hunts give rewards for unique movements throughout gameplay. In daily challenges, the player needs to collect letters that constitute a word related to the game, such as "score" and "jump"; also known as "word hunt".[3][4] Missions have various tasks measured by player accuracy. Up to 18 characters can be unlocked using coins, keys, in-game purchases, collecting specific items, or connecting to a Facebook account. Most characters have up to 2 different outfits. Meanwhile, up to 17 hoverboards can be unlocked with the same methods. Each has different abilities that can assist the player. When the game updates to a new location, a new character, and hoverboard will be available temporarily until the next update.</p>
